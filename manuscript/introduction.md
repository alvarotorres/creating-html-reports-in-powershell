**Check for Updates!** Our ebooks are often updated with new and corrected content. We make them available in three ways:

* Our main, authoritative [GitHub organization](https://github.com/devops-collective-inc), with a repo for each book. Visit https://github.com/devops-collective-inc/
* Our [GitBook page](https://www.gitbook.com/@devopscollective), where you can browse books online, or download as PDF, EPUB, or MOBI. Using the online reader, you can link to specific chapters. Visit https://www.gitbook.com/@devopscollective
* On [LeanPub](https://leanpub.com/u/devopscollective), where you can download as PDF, EPUB, or MOBI (login required), and "purchase" the books to make a donation to DevOps Collective. You can also choose to be notified of updates. Visit https://leanpub.com/u/devopscollective

GitBook and LeanPub have slightly different PDF formatting output, so you can choose the one you prefer. LeanPub can also notify you when we push updates. Our main GitHub repo is authoritative; repositories on other sites are usually just mirrors used for the publishing process. GitBook will usually contain our latest version, including not-yet-finished bits; LeanPub always contains the most recent "public release" of any book.
